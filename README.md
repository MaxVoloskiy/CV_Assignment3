# Summary

* **What:**

  * The authors present us that large Generative Adversarial Networks trained on the complex dataset are able to produce video samples of substantially high complexity and fidelity
  * Dual Video Discriminator GAN (DVD_GAN) scales to longer and higher resolution videos.
  * Evaluation of video synthesis and video prediction, and achieve new state-of-the-art Fr√©chet Inception Distance for prediction.
  
* **How:**

  *
  *

  * 
  
* **Results:**

  * **KINETICS-600**
